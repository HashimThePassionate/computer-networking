# 📡 **Exploring Wireless Networking**

When designing a wireless network for an organization, it is important to consider several key factors:

  * The components needed.
  * The number of wireless clients that need access to the wireless network.
  * The location of these clients within the organization.

The components needed are typically **access points (APs)** or **wireless routers**, based on the size of the organization and the number of users on the wireless network.


### 🏠 Wireless Routers

Wireless routers are common networking devices, particularly found within **Small Office Home Office (SOHO)** networks. This type of wireless networking device is an all-in-one unified device that combines a:

  * Router
  * Switch
  * Access Point

A wireless router is suitable for small wireless networks, such as those within homes and small office environments.

The following snippet shows the back of a Cisco Linksys 160N wireless router:

<div align="center">
  <img src="./images/01.png" width="600"/>

  Figure 10.1 – Wireless router
</div>

As shown in the preceding snippet, there are five interfaces that allow wired Ethernet connections.

  * **Internet Port**: This port (often yellow) is sometimes referred to as the **Wide Area Network (WAN)** port. It allows a network professional to establish a wired connection from the internet modem to the wireless router.
  * **Ethernet Ports**: This 4-port group (often blue) acts as a local switch.

The purpose of the Internet/WAN port is to provide internet access to devices that are connected to the wireless router. Without internet access on the wireless router, wireless clients would be able to communicate with each other locally but would not be able to access any resources on the internet.

The following diagram shows the connection between an internet modem and a wireless router.

<div align="center">
  <img src="./images/02.png" width="600"/>

  Figure 10.2 – Providing internet to a wireless router
</div>


Additionally, the wireless router has one or more Ethernet ports (the 4-port switch) that operate like a typical network switch. This allows network professionals to interconnect clients with each other using a wired connection. The built-in switch within the wireless router functions like a typical network switch that forwards frames between devices on the wired and wireless networks.

Therefore, all devices that are connected to the wireless router, whether on the wireless or wired network, will be able to communicate and exchange messages with each other.


### ⚙️ Router Functions

Furthermore, the wireless router leverages several built-in features:

  * **Access Point Feature**: This generates radio frequencies within the **2.4 GHz** and/or **5 GHz** band to create a wireless network, allowing wireless clients to connect to the device.
  * **Router Functionality**: This allows devices that are connected to the wired and wireless network types to intercommunicate with each other.
  * **DHCP Server**: The router feature allows network professionals to create a **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)** server within the wireless router. This server provides all connected clients with:
      * IP addresses
      * Subnet mask
      * Default gateway
      * Domain Name System (DNS) server addresses

The following diagram shows the different networks that exist when using a wireless router.

<div align="center">
  <img src="./images/03.png" width="600"/>

  Figure 10.3 – Wireless networking
</div>

As shown in the preceding diagram:

  * Clients that are connected to the wireless network (the LAN) generated by the wireless router use IP addresses on the **172.16.1.0/24** network.
  * The network that exists between the modem and the internet port of the wireless router (the WAN) is in the **192.168.1.0/24** network range.

Hence, the router function is used to forward packets between these different IP subnets and to the internet.


### 🏢 Access Points (APs)

In medium-sized to large organizations, **access points (APs)** are commonly implemented to provide wireless coverage to all areas within a building.

Access points simply generate a radio frequency that is supported by wireless devices, allowing wireless clients (such as mobile devices) to establish a connection to the AP and access the resources on the wired network.

Unlike wireless routers, access points typically do not have any routing or switching functionality; they are simply used to create a wireless network and forward frames to the wired network and vice versa.

  * **Thin-Client Access Point**: This is a type of AP that has no configuration capability on its own. It is "thin" because it relies on a central **wireless controller** to function and get its configuration.
  * **Fat-Client Access Point**: This type of AP, on the other hand, can be individually configured and does not require a controller.

Clients that are connected to access points receive an IP address that is provided to the clients on the wired network (e.g., from a central DHCP server). Hence, access points are simply used to allow wireless clients to access the organization’s network seamlessly, as if they were connected to the wired network.

# 📡 **Beacons, Probes, Stations, and SSIDs**

## 🏷️ Service Set Identifier (SSID)

The **Service Set Identifier (SSID)** is simply the name of your wireless network. It is what allows wireless clients (like your phone or laptop) to identify one wireless network from another.

Imagine if setting an SSID was not an option on your wireless router or access point; it would be quite challenging for users to find and identify their specific wireless network from their neighbor's.

Home users and organizations usually change the default SSID (which is configured by the vendor) to a name that is recognizable.

### 🔒 Security and Naming

As a good security practice, organizations should **not** set an SSID that can easily identify the organization or attract (lure) a hacker.

For instance, many IT professionals might configure their wireless networks with easily identifiable SSIDs, such as using their company’s name. While this concept provides a lot of convenience for employees, it also helps a hacker easily identify a target wireless network.

## 📢 Beacons

When a wireless router or access point is powered on, its firmware and configurations are loaded into memory. The device then begins to broadcast its presence within the vicinity.

Wireless routers and access points continuously broadcast **beacons**. These are small packets of information that contain specific details about the wireless network, such as:

  * The SSID (the network name)
  * The wireless encryption standard (e.g., WPA2, WPA3)
  * The operating channel
  * The device's Media Access Control (MAC) address

These beacons are detected and inspected by any device that has a supported wireless network adapter (such as smartphones, tablets, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and laptops). This process is what allows a user to see a list of available wireless networks.

The following diagram shows a wireless router broadcasting beacons.

<div align="center">
  <img src="./images/04.png" width="600"/>

  Figure 10.4 – Wireless beacons
</div>

As shown in the preceding diagram, as wireless clients move into the range of the wireless signal, they will be able to capture these beacons and inspect them to determine which wireless network is close by.

### "Hiding" Your Wireless Network

Wireless routers and access points provide the capability of **disabling the SSID broadcast**. This is often used as a technique for "hiding" your wireless network from other wireless clients.

However, this technique **does not add any real layer of security**. A seasoned hacker or cybersecurity professional can discover a "hidden" wireless network within a few seconds. They can do this by performing wireless reconnaissance, which involves capturing beacons and probes.

If an IT professional chooses to disable the SSID broadcast feature, the wireless router will *still* broadcast beacons, but it will not insert the SSID. All other information will still be included.

By analyzing the data within these captured beacons and probes, a seasoned hacker can determine:

  * The type of clients and wireless routers within the area.
  * The hidden wireless networks.
  * The type of security configurations applied to the networks.
  * Even the approximate distance between the attacker’s machine and the target wireless router and clients.

The following snippet shows the basic configuration page of a wireless router where this setting can be changed.

<div align="center">
  <img src="./images/05.png" width="600"/>

  Figure 10.5 – Wireless router basic configuration page
</div>

As shown in the preceding snippet, the basic wireless configuration page allows a user to configure the wireless operating standard (`Network Mode`), the SSID (`Network Name`), `Channel Width`, `Channel`, and whether to **enable or disable the SSID broadcast** on the device.

## 💻 Stations and Probes

When a wireless client (also known as a **station**) establishes a connection to a wireless router or access point, this is referred to as an **association**.

> #### 📝 Important Note
>
> Wireless clients, such as laptops, smart TVs, and IoT devices, are all examples of **stations** on a wireless network. The terms "wireless clients" and "stations" are used interchangeably during discussions and literature.

When a client joins a wireless network, it saves both the SSID and password into a **Preferred Network List (PNL)**. This list allows the user to easily re-join the same wireless network in the future.

This PNL feature enables the wireless network adapter on a client to begin sending **probes** (or probe requests) for each entry within its PNL. The probes allow the client to "seek" or ask for any of the wireless networks (via their SSIDs) that are stored in its PNL. Once a wireless network is found within the signal range, the client will attempt to create an association with that network.

### ⚠️ Security Risks of Probes

A seasoned hacker or cybersecurity professional can capture these probes to determine all the wireless networks that are stored on a client's device. They can then attempt to perform an "AP-less" attack to retrieve the password/passphrase of an organization’s wireless network.

However, many newer devices are now allowing IT professionals to prevent the client from automatically connecting to a saved wireless network that is within range.

# 📡 **Frequencies, Ranges, and Channels**

The **Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)** is the governing body that creates and currently maintains the standards and frameworks for both electrical and electronics specifications. This includes computers and wireless networking.

The **802 committee** of the IEEE holds the responsibility of creating and maintaining many common standards that are used by both computing and networking devices, such as Ethernet, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi.

The **.11 working group** of the 802 committee is specifically responsible for the wireless networking standard, known as the **IEEE 802.11 wireless networking standard**, within the industry.


### 📜 IEEE 802.11 Wireless Standards

The following table shows the different IEEE 802.11 wireless standards.

<div align="center">
  <img src="./images/06.png" width="600"/>

  Figure 10.6 – Wireless standards
</div>

As shown in the preceding table, there are many generations of IEEE 802.11 within the wireless networking industry.

  * **Original IEEE 802.11 (1997):** This was designed to operate on a 2.4 GHz frequency and supported a maximum data transfer rate of 2 Megabits per second (Mbps). However, this original standard was not implemented on any device.
  * **IEEE 802.11b (1999):** This became the first official wireless standard that was implemented on devices. It operated on 2.4 GHz and provided a maximum data transfer rate of 11 Mbps.
  * **IEEE 802.11a (1999):** This standard operates on the 5 GHz frequency and provides a maximum data transfer rate of 54 Mbps.
  * **IEEE 802.11g (2003):** This standard operates at 2.4 GHz and supports maximum transfer rates of 54 Mbps.
  * **IEEE 802.11n (Wi-Fi 4, 2009):** Also known as Wi-Fi 4, this standard operates on *both* the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequencies. It supports **Multiple In Multiple Out (MIMO)**, which improves the maximum data transfer rate up to 300 Mbps.
  * **IEEE 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5, 2013):** This standard operates on the 5 GHz frequency and provides a maximum data transfer rate of 1 Gigabit per second (Gbps).
  * **IEEE 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6, 2019):** This is the latest version, which uses both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequencies and provides a maximum data transfer rate of 9.6 Gbps.

Overall, the speed and bandwidth that are supported on wireless networks are aligning with the speeds on wired networks, allowing users to exchange messages very quickly.


### 📶 The 2.4 GHz Band

The IEEE 802.11 standards use the **2.4 GHz** range, which has a total of 14 channels. These channels range from 2.400 GHz to 2.490 GHz, with each individual channel having a width of 20 MHz to 22 MHz for transporting messages.

Since these individual channels are very close to each other, it is recommended to configure wireless routers and access points with **non-overlapping channels**, such as channels **1, 6, and 11**.

The following diagram shows a representation of the non-overlapping channels.

<div align="center">
  <img src="./images/07.png" width="600"/>

  Figure 10.7 – Non-overlapping channels
</div>

It is important to ensure your organization’s access points are not using any channels that are overlapping with other access points within the vicinity. This will create **interference** and affect the performance of the wireless network.

However, the earlier generations of IEEE 802.11 primarily use the 2.4 GHz range. As a result, many organizations and home users who already have an existing wireless network are using the 2.4 GHz range. Therefore, if you were to implement a new wireless router or access point, there is a high possibility that another access point within the same vicinity is using an overlapping channel. This issue is due to the limited number of available channels in the 2.4 GHz range.

> **💡 Tip**
>
> Using a **Wi-Fi analyzer tool**, such as **inSSIDer** from Metageek or the **Wi-Fi Analyzer** app from the Microsoft Store, allows network professionals to:
>
>   * View all nearby wireless networks.
>   * See their operating frequencies and channels, SSIDs, vendors, and much more.
>   * Determine whether your wireless network is using an overlapping channel with another nearby Access Point.


### 🚀 The 5 GHz Band

The **5 GHz** range supports a lot more channels compared to the 2.4 GHz band, with channels ranging from **36 to 165**.

Unlike the 2.4 GHz band, the 5 GHz band allows devices to use channels of 20 MHz, 40 MHz, 80 MHz, and 160 MHz by using a technology known as **channel bonding**. Using channel bonding in the 5 GHz band allows wireless devices to transport more data over the wireless network, hence the 5 GHz band supports more bandwidth compared to the 2.4 GHz band.


### ⚖️ Wireless Band Comparison

The following table shows a comparison between the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands.

<div align="center">
  <img src="./images/08.png" width="600"/>

  Figure 10.8 – Wireless band comparison
</div>

As shown in the preceding table:

  * The **2.4 GHz band** provides **better signal strength**, allowing the radio frequency signal to travel further away from the wireless router or access point, resulting in **better range**.
  * The **5 GHz band**, on the other hand, operates on a higher frequency and **does not provide the same signal strength or range**. However, the 5 GHz band supports more channels and channel bonding to provide **greater bandwidth** and **less interference**.

# 📡 **SSID and Wireless Topologies**

The **Service Set Identifier (SSID)** allows network professionals to create a network name that is 32-bits in length. This name helps users easily identify their preferred wireless network.

When implementing a wireless network infrastructure within a building, office space, or home, it is important to understand the characteristics of the various types of wireless network infrastructure deployments.

The topology of a wireless network can be in **infrastructure**, **ad hoc**, or **mesh** modes.

  * **Infrastructure Mode**: A wireless Access Point (AP) is used as the network intermediary device. It allows wireless clients to connect and share resources.
  * **Ad Hoc Mode**: This mode does not use any wireless intermediary devices. Instead, a wireless device (like a laptop) can directly connect to another laptop to share resources.
  * **Mesh Mode**: All wireless devices establish a connection with each other, hence creating a mesh topology.

### 🏠 Basic Service Set (BSS)

A **Basic Service Set (BSS)** is the most common type of wireless infrastructure. It contains a **single** wireless router or access point, allowing wireless clients within the vicinity to connect to it.

The wireless router or access point is simply the intermediary wireless networking device. It is used to forward WLAN frames between wireless clients and onto the wired network, which is known as a **Distributed System Service (DSS)**.

The following diagram shows a typical wireless network that is configured as a BSS:

<div align="center">
  <img src="./images/09.png" width="600"/>

Figure 10.9 – BSS wireless infrastructure
</div>

> #### 📝 Important Note
>
> Any wireless network that uses a wireless router or access point as the wireless network intermediary device is commonly referred to as **infrastructure mode**.

### 🏢 Extended Service Set (ESS)

The **Extended Service Set (ESS)** is commonly found within medium-sized to large organizations. It features **multiple access points** connected to the same DSS (wired network).

This wireless network exists when network professionals implement two or more access points that are connected to the same wired network. Each access point is configured with the **same SSID**. This allows a user with a laptop to **roam** between different access points within the office space or building.

Roaming allows a user to automatically connect to another access point with the same SSID when moving out of range from one access point (that has a weaker signal) and closer to another (that is broadcasting a stronger signal) with the same SSID.

The following diagram shows a typical ESS wireless infrastructure:

<div align="center">
  <img src="./images/10.png" width="600"/>

Figure 10.10 – ESS wireless infrastructure
</div>

As shown in the preceding diagram, there are two access points that are configured with the same SSID. This allows wireless clients to automatically connect to the access point with the better signal. When a wireless client is disconnecting from one access point and connecting to another, the user will experience a temporary drop in wireless network connectivity until the wireless client re-establishes an association with the new access point.

### 💻 Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS)

An **Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS)** is a wireless network that does **not** use a wireless router or access point. In an IBSS, each wireless client is connected to every other wireless client within the vicinity, creating a wireless mesh network. This type of wireless network allows clients to share their resources directly with another client and is commonly referred to as **ad hoc mode**.

The following diagram shows a typical IBSS wireless network:

<div align="center">
  <img src="./images/11.png" width="600"/>

Figure 10.11 – IBSS wireless network
</div>

As shown in the preceding diagram, each wireless client, such as a laptop, can be configured to operate as an access point. This allows other wireless clients to connect and share resources with each other without the need for a dedicated wireless router.
