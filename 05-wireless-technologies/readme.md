# 📡 **Exploring Wireless Networking**

When designing a wireless network for an organization, it is important to consider several key factors:

  * The components needed.
  * The number of wireless clients that need access to the wireless network.
  * The location of these clients within the organization.

The components needed are typically **access points (APs)** or **wireless routers**, based on the size of the organization and the number of users on the wireless network.


### 🏠 Wireless Routers

Wireless routers are common networking devices, particularly found within **Small Office Home Office (SOHO)** networks. This type of wireless networking device is an all-in-one unified device that combines a:

  * Router
  * Switch
  * Access Point

A wireless router is suitable for small wireless networks, such as those within homes and small office environments.

The following snippet shows the back of a Cisco Linksys 160N wireless router:

As shown in the preceding snippet, there are five interfaces that allow wired Ethernet connections.

  * **Internet Port**: This port (often yellow) is sometimes referred to as the **Wide Area Network (WAN)** port. It allows a network professional to establish a wired connection from the internet modem to the wireless router.
  * **Ethernet Ports**: This 4-port group (often blue) acts as a local switch.

The purpose of the Internet/WAN port is to provide internet access to devices that are connected to the wireless router. Without internet access on the wireless router, wireless clients would be able to communicate with each other locally but would not be able to access any resources on the internet.

The following diagram shows the connection between an internet modem and a wireless router.

Additionally, the wireless router has one or more Ethernet ports (the 4-port switch) that operate like a typical network switch. This allows network professionals to interconnect clients with each other using a wired connection. The built-in switch within the wireless router functions like a typical network switch that forwards frames between devices on the wired and wireless networks.

Therefore, all devices that are connected to the wireless router, whether on the wireless or wired network, will be able to communicate and exchange messages with each other.


### ⚙️ Router Functions

Furthermore, the wireless router leverages several built-in features:

  * **Access Point Feature**: This generates radio frequencies within the **2.4 GHz** and/or **5 GHz** band to create a wireless network, allowing wireless clients to connect to the device.
  * **Router Functionality**: This allows devices that are connected to the wired and wireless network types to intercommunicate with each other.
  * **DHCP Server**: The router feature allows network professionals to create a **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)** server within the wireless router. This server provides all connected clients with:
      * IP addresses
      * Subnet mask
      * Default gateway
      * Domain Name System (DNS) server addresses

The following diagram shows the different networks that exist when using a wireless router.

As shown in the preceding diagram:

  * Clients that are connected to the wireless network (the LAN) generated by the wireless router use IP addresses on the **172.16.1.0/24** network.
  * The network that exists between the modem and the internet port of the wireless router (the WAN) is in the **192.168.1.0/24** network range.

Hence, the router function is used to forward packets between these different IP subnets and to the internet.


### 🏢 Access Points (APs)

In medium-sized to large organizations, **access points (APs)** are commonly implemented to provide wireless coverage to all areas within a building.

Access points simply generate a radio frequency that is supported by wireless devices, allowing wireless clients (such as mobile devices) to establish a connection to the AP and access the resources on the wired network.

Unlike wireless routers, access points typically do not have any routing or switching functionality; they are simply used to create a wireless network and forward frames to the wired network and vice versa.

  * **Thin-Client Access Point**: This is a type of AP that has no configuration capability on its own. It is "thin" because it relies on a central **wireless controller** to function and get its configuration.
  * **Fat-Client Access Point**: This type of AP, on the other hand, can be individually configured and does not require a controller.

Clients that are connected to access points receive an IP address that is provided to the clients on the wired network (e.g., from a central DHCP server). Hence, access points are simply used to allow wireless clients to access the organization’s network seamlessly, as if they were connected to the wired network.
