# üõ∞Ô∏è **Exploring Routing Concepts**

Routers are **Layer 3 devices**. They operate at the **Network layer** of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) and the **Internet layer** of the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) networking models.

Routers are one of the most essential networking devices found within private and public networks. They allow network professionals to interconnect two or more different networks together and forward packets to their destinations.

For instance, routers can:
* **Interconnect different IP subnets**, allowing devices on one IP network to communicate with hosts on another IP network.
* **Interconnect networks with different media types**, such as connecting an Ethernet network with a fiber optic network.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Core and Advanced Functions

Routers are built to perform many Layer 3 operations, such as:
* **Network Address Translation (NAT)**
* **Filtering traffic** using Access Control Lists (ACLs)
* **Virtual Private Network (VPN)** capabilities, allowing network professionals to set up site-to-site and remote access VPNs.

However, all routers have one **core function**: to route or forward packets to their destinations efficiently, using the **most suitable path**.

For instance, have you ever wondered how your computer or smartphone can communicate with servers on the internet? Or how routers can forward your packets to the intended destination network or host?

Routers are configured with **routing protocols**. These protocols use an **algorithm** that helps them determine the **best path** or route to a destination. Between your device and a server on the internet, many paths are available that can be used to forward the packets. However, not all paths are suitable due to various factors within each path.


## üó∫Ô∏è Finding the Best Path

Imagine if the routers within an Internet Service Provider (ISP) network forward packets along paths that were heavily congested with a lot of network traffic (load). All the internet subscribers of that particular ISP will experience **high latency**, which causes slow response times when they are communicating with hosts on the internet.

Using **dynamic routing protocols** helps routers calculate the best path from a source to a destination. They do this by assigning **metric values** to various factors about a path, such as the following:

* Cumulative bandwidth
* Latency
* Reliability
* Outgoing load (TX load)
* Receiving load (RX load)
* Hop count
* Path


## üìñ The Routing Table

Each algorithm within a dynamic routing protocol uses one or more of these factors to determine and install the best path to a destination within the **routing table** of a router.

Each router has a **local routing table** that contains a list of destination routes or paths. This table simply tells the router how to forward a packet to its destination.
